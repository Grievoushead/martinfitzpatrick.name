#Method

For each preserved sample add 6ml media (RPMI+10% FCS) to a 15ml tube.



Defrost frozen samples in water bath at 37&#39;C. Rinse with EtOH to clean before transferring to tissue culture hood.



Pasteur all cells from sample into 6ml media, transfer back and forth to rinse.



Centrifuge 15ml tube at 1200rpm 6 minutes to pellet.



Pour off supernatant and resuspend in 2ml media. Transfer into 25cm^2 flask.



Incubate overnight.



If cells are respirating effectively media will turn yellow. Add media up to 5ml to culture.
