Pre-chill pipettes and place 12mL rat tail type 1 collagen (&gt;3.8mg/mL) on ice

<aside>NOTE: Everything is kept cold to avoid the collagen solidifying</aside>



Mix 1.5mL of 10x DMEM with 1.5mL of 10x reconstitution buffer, keep on ice.



Count J2-3T3s and pellet required number in a universal.



Add the 3mL of [1:1, 10x DMEM and 10x reconstitution buffer] and swirl to resuspend the cells, keep on ice.



Using chilled pipette, add the 12mL of collagen gently to the cells and tilt to mix, avoiding bubbles as far as possible.



Add 10N NaOH to bring the pH up to 7

NOTE: You may judge the pH visually by the phenol red in the DMEM. Approximately 30–60mL will be required. Use the glacial AcCOOH if necessary but more mixing means more bubbles.



Pipette 2–2.5mL into each well and incubate O/N



Add 2mL raft media on top of each matrix.



Use within 1 week, change media every 2 days.
