Basic protocol for Eosin & Haematoxylin histological preparation of microdissection slide.









For paraffin-embedded sections, place slides into fresh xylene to remove parrafin. 



Place slide into fresh xyline



Transfer slide to 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, then 70% ethanol; 30 seconds/step



Transfer slide into de-ionized water



Transfer slide into Mayer's Haematoxylin



Return to de-ionized water to rinse for 15 seconds x2 changing dH20 between steps



Transfer slide to 70% ethanol



Transfer slide into Eosin Y



Return to de-ionized water to rinse for 30 seconds x2



To reduce brittleness of tissue, place in 3% glycerol in de-ionized water



Shake and air dry to remove layer of glycerol and water



Microdissection is best performed in the following 5-10 minutes following preparation. If if tissue dries return tissue to 3% glycerol/water; step #10
