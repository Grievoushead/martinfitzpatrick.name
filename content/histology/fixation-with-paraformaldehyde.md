Fixation with paraformaldehyde









Add 41.5ml 2.26% sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate to a suitable heat-proof container



Add 8.5ml sodium hydroxide 2.52%



Heat to 60-80'C in a covered container



Add 2g 'Analar' paraformaldehyde, stirring thoroughly until dissolved. 

Adding a couple of drops of 1M NaOH can help the PFA dissolve.



Allow to cool and filter to remove particulates. Recheck pH.



Store at RT and ideally use within 48h.
