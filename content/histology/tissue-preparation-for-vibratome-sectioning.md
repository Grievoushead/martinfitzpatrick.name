Tissue preparation for vibratome sectioning.









Fix in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS pH 7.2-7.4.



Remove excess fixative by washing tissues in PBS x 3.



Embed in warm 40ºC 4% agarose in distilled water (dH20).



Cool tissue blocks to 25ºC or until the agarose solidifies.



Trim excess agarose away and attach blocks to metal chuck using cyanoacrylate adhesive.



Cut sections to 30-50µm Vibratome sections.



Collect sections in 0.1M PBS (add azide 0.05% for long term storage>1 week).
