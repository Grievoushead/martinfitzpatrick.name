Dilute stock DAPI mix to a concentration of 3uM in staining buffer, allowing a total of 1ml per sample.



Centrifuge cell suspension at 1200rpm for 5 minutes to pellet. Pour off supernatant.



Tap/agitate to dislodge and re-suspend cells in remaining buffer. 



Add 1ml of diluted DAPI to each sample



Incubate for 15 minutes at room temperature



Analyze cells as required:

For *flow cytometry* leave cells in DAPI solution.

For *fluorescence microscopy* pellet cells by centrifugation, remove supernatant and resuspend in PBS. Add a drop of cells to a slide and cover with coverslip.
