Title: About
Slug: about

I am a final-year PhD student working on the metabolomics of inflammatory diseases. 
I combine standard metaboomic techniques, such as NMR, with immunological based functional
assays to determine the function, importance and stability of metabolism in inflammatory diseases.

Alongside the development of these methods, I've developed a number of software tools to 
speed up the process of interpretation in metabolic pathways. All my published software
is available open source [here][software].

I'm based at the [University of Birmingham][uob] in the United Kingdom.

I also enjoy playing squash poorly and drinking almost everything well.

### What's all this then?

On this site you'll find details of my publications and software, together with articles
relating to how to make use of one or the other. There are also historic protocols collected from around the web that I've
collated and fixed up with their original author's permission. Everything you see here is licensed [CC-BY-SA][cc-by-sa].

Have fun!
