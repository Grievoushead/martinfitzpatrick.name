## Statement

Investigating the characteristic metabolic profiles of differentiated M1 and M2 macrophages. Investigate the effects of hypoxia on differentiation to these characteristic profiles and integrate this with understanding of cellular activation, cytokine production and gene transcription. Understand whether other potential environmental factors modify the host cell metabolism.

Have developed skills in a broad range of laboratory techniques including ELISA, PCR,  immunohistology, including dissection, cryostat sectioning,
immunofluorescence staining, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry (FACS)

In 2009 I applied and was successfully awarded a scholarship from
the Arthur Thompson Trust to undertake an 8-week research project during which I investigated the mechanisms of B cell localisation in the thymus. The final year dissertation project looking into the effects of vaccination on the development of adaptive immunity after infection using a mouse *Salmonella* model.

I was awarded the a scholarship as part of the Wellcome Trust Combined Training Programme at the University of Birmingham, where I undertook 2 short projects: *“Tracking viral entry into target cells by virological and immunological methods”* and *“Do differentiated macrophages display distinct metabolic phenotypes reflecting their different functions?”*

I took the latter project forward into my PhD studies, taking the opportunity to bridge the gap between my computational and biological research skills.
