In 2009 I applied and was successfully awarded a scholarship from
the Arthur Thompson Trust to undertake an 8-week research project during which I investigated the mechanisms of B cell localisation in the thymus. The final year dissertation project looking into the effects of vaccination on the development of adaptive immunity after infection using a mouse *Salmonella* model.

I was awarded the a scholarship as part of the Wellcome Trust Combined Training Programme at the University of Birmingham, where I undertook 2 short projects: *“Tracking viral entry into target cells by virological and immunological methods”* and *“Do differentiated macrophages display distinct metabolic phenotypes reflecting their different functions?”*  


Investigating the characteristic metabolic profiles of differentiated M1 and M2 macrophages. Investigate the effects of hypoxia on differentiation to these characteristic profiles and integrate this with understanding of cellular activation, cytokine production and gene transcription. Understand whether other potential environmental factors modify the host cell metabolism.

This required the development of novel analysis tools to help visualise the complex resulting datasets in a way that allowed for interpretation. The first result of this has been the release of the [MetaPath][metapath] application.

Have developed skills in a broad range of laboratory techniques including ELISA, PCR,  immunohistology, including dissection, cryostat sectioning,
immunofluorescence staining, confocal microscopy and flow cytometry (FACS)
