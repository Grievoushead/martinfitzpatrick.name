Below is a list of all software I've released to date as part of my research. Unless I have taken
temporary leave of my senses all of it will be under some form of open-source
license (GPLv3 or MIT/BSD).


### [MetaPath: Metabolic pathway visualisation and analysis][metapath]  
<img src="/static/images/software/metapath_0.5.1_screenshot_sm.png" class="inline left">MetaPath is a tool for the analysis of metabolic pathway and associated
visualisation of experimental data. Built on the MetaCyc database it provides
an interactive map in which multiple pathways can be simultaneously visualised.
Multiple annotations from the MetaCyc database are available including synonyms,
associated reactions and pathways and database unification links.

*Available for free under the GNU General Pubic License v3*

### [GPML2SVG: A command-line/Python GPML to SVG pathway renderer][gpml2svg]
GPML2SVG is a command line program and Python API for the conversion of pathways marked up using the GPML format, as supported by PathVisio and WikiPathways. It additionally
supports XRef linking, node colouring and synonym-recoding (so you can use alternative IDs if you have an appropriate conversion list).
