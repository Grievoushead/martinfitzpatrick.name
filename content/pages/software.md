Below is a list of all software I've released to date as part of my research. Unless I have taken

### Metabolomics

[MetaPath: Metabolic pathway visualisation and analysis][metapath]  
<img src="/static/images/software/metapath_0.5.1_screenshot_sm.png" class="inline left">MetaPath is a tool for the analysis of metabolic pathway and associated
visualisation of experimental data. Built on the MetaCyc database it provides
an interactive map in which multiple pathways can be simultaneously visualised.
Multiple annotations from the MetaCyc database are available including synonyms,
associated reactions and pathways and database unification links.
