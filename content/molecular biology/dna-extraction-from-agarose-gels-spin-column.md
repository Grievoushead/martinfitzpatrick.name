These are excellent for extracting DNA if you can afford them. They cost 1–2 US$ each. Manufacterers include Qiagen, Sigma, Novagen









Dissolve the gel-slice in 3 volumes of chaotropic agent at 50C for 10 minutes



Apply the solution to a spin-column and spin for 1 minute (the DNA remains in the column)



Wash the column by passing 70% ethanol through (the DNA remains in the column, salt and impurities are washed out)



Elute the DNA in a small volume (30µL) of water or buffer, spin to collect.
