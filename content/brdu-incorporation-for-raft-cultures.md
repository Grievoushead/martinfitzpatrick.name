Prepare stocks of BrdU at 10mg/ml in H2O, filter sterilise and store in working aliquots (eg. 200 microlitres) at â€“20C.



Incubate rafts with BrdU (100 microgram per ml) for 12 hours prior to harvesting.



Detect incorporated BrdU via antibody staining (Zymed 18-0103) using standard immunohistochemical techniques
