#Method

Seed cells at 2.5x105 cells/ml as 4ml cultures in 25cm2 flasks. 

If seeding to plates, seed to base-density of approximately 1x106 cells/25cm2 e.g. 
1cm2 well = 3.14cm2
25/3.14 = 8
1/8 = 0.125 x 10^6 cells/well



Differentiation can be induced with 100nM ATRA (neutrophils) or 100nM 1a,25(OH)2D3 (monocytes)



Re-feed cells late on day 2 or morning day 3, ensuring stocks stay below 1x106/ml to avoid spontaneously differentiation



First signs of differentiation will appear day 3



Complete differentiation should be apparent day 5
